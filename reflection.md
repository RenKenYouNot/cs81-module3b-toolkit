The format of all the functions are relatively similar. The only thing that changes is the name of the
function and the operators that will be used. The same goes for running the functions in console.
The only thing I found difficult was remembering to use the correct === and !== symbols. I tried
to run my isOdd function in my console and couldn't figure out why it was incorrect and it was
because i forgot to remove the extra = symbol. This toolkit could be very useful in coding because 
these small functions are fundamental math operations that get used all the time in real-world
calculations.
